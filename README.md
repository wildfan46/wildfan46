# Hi, I'm Austin 👋
### Senior Software Engineer | Full-Stack

I've been building professional software since 2018. While my contribution graph may 
look quiet at times, it's because I spend most of my time shipping code within 
private Enterprise environments. This profile captures mostly hobby/home projects
since 2022, but also includes professional experience before that.

## 🏡Personal Projects
My hobby/home projects that you might find in this profile:
- [`task checker`](https://github.com/wildfan46/task-checker)A python lambda that runs via EventBridge to query weather data and my previous "todo list" items to
conditionally add new items to my list, in order to help my plan my day before I even wake up.
- My personal portfolio website hosted on Fly.io and a bff powered by a Python Lambda in AWS.
- A fun discord bot I made for some friends to track activities in a shared discord server. This one
works by a lambda and stores the data in a dynamo db.
